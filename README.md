![Game Demo](updated.gif)
### Usage

Make sure to have node.js installed.
Install the dependencies and start both dev servers.

```sh
$ npm install
```

Open multiple client tabs to play (within a single local network).

In a dev/prod environment, the client is bundled into a dist directory and is served by the node app as static content.

First build client, and run server
```sh
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

Then access through `localhost:5000` (Try with multiple client tabs)
