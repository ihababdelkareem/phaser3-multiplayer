### Usage

Make sure to have node.js installed.
Install the dependencies and start both dev servers.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
Open multiple client tabs to play (within a single local network).

In a dev/prod environment, the client is bundled into build directory and is served by the node app as static content.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run server
```
